# TLS Implementation in C (Educational Project)

This repository contains a **minimal TLS (Transport Layer Security)** implementation in **C**, built from scratch for *learning purposes*. It follows along with the book *Implementing TLS*, exploring key components of TLS protocols by coding them manually.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is an educational project **not suitable for production**. Security is simplified for learning clarity.
